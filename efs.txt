NOTES:
------
1. Some times mount using DNS doesn't or it takes time to propogate; try using IP base mounting
2. Ensure security group attached to EFS allows NFS (2029) traffic from EC2 instance SG
3. Make sure you have added appropriate AZ in which EC2 are running 
4. Each mount target is represented as a ENI (elastic network interface). You can attach single or multiple security groups 

EC2:
----
1. Install dependencies - sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
2. Make mount directory - mkdir <directory name>
3. Mount Target example: sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport 10.0.1.29:/ <directory name>
4. Your are ready with the shared storage network

Some handy linux commands
--------------------------
- sudo touch <filename>  [Created the file]
- ll                     [Total files in the shared storage]
