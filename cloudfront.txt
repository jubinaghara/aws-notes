Notes:
====================================
1. Gep-Restrictions
 - You can whitelist or black list coutries

2. Origins and Groups
 - First, add additional Buckets/Elastic Load balancer/etc to the Cloud Front distribution
 - Second, create orging-group, select list of destination (selected above) and define the priority of the Origins. 
   If the primary origing fails CloudFront will direct traffic to the secondary origin.
-  Third, Under Behavior select the configured orgin group AND done.
With above setting, CF will now redirect the request first to primary origin and if health is failed than origin will redirect to seconday origins.
