Notes:
========
1. Scaling policies can be on CPU, Network and even custom metrics
2. Uses Lauch config or template (new)
3. To updaete an ASG, you must provide a new launch configuration / template
4. IAM roles attaches to an ASG will get assigned to EC2 instance
5. ASG automatically creates new instance when instance is marked as unhealthy
6. If you ASG Group has Max capacity 1 and you have set scaling policy to add 2 units on some metric it will not work
7. What happens when you delete ASG
    - all instance created by ASG gets terminate
    - ALB target group will deregister instances
    - please note LB and Target group itself will not get deleted

Install stress utility to test scaling policies
