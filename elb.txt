Notes:
======
1. Expose single DNS
2. Do regular health checks
3. Provide SSL (HTTPS) termination for your websites
4. Enforce stickiness with cookies
5. HA accros mulitple AZs
6. Seprate public traffic from private traffic
7. Separate SG group for ELB (allowing traffic from Internet) and SG for EC2 allows traffic only from SG of ELB
8. LB scale but not instantaneoulslyh - contact AWS for a "warm-up"


CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER
-----------------------
1. Create > Add Subnets (>2 AZ) > Add SG > Configure Health Check > Add Instance  > Tag > doesn
2. Advanced configuration
   - Stickness (app generated cookie stickness or LB generated cookie stickness)
   - Cross Zone LB (default enable)
   - Can add/edit Instance
   - Can migrate to ALB
3. HTTP/HTTPS or TCP
4. Cross zone load-balancing is enabled by default  (Can be disabled - No charges for inter AZ data)
5. Support only on SSL Certificate

APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER (LAYER 7 ONLY)
----------------------------------------
1. Create > Internet / Internal > IPv4 / dualstack >  Add Subnet > Target group
    Target group: Select > Type (IP, Instance, Lambda) > Proto (HTTP, HTTPS) > Port > Health Check > Add Instance

2. IP based target group:
   - Supports load balancing to VPC and on-premises resources.
   - Facilitates routing to multiple IP addresses and network interfaces on the same instance.
   - Offers flexibility with microservice based architectures, simplifying inter-application communication.

3. Listner Condition
   - Multiple rules (up to 100) to match condition based on SrcIP, Path, Http header, Http request method, Query string
   - If match found Forward to: (Target Group), Redirect to (Target Group) Or Return fixed response

4. You can route request to multiple application usings single ALB using above conditions (this is not possible with Classic ELB)
5. Advance options
    - WAF enable
    - Global Acceleration 

6. Target groups
   - Can be EC2
   - Can be ECS tasks
   - Can be Lambda function
   - Can be IP address which allows routing traffic to on-premise datacenter
   - Stickness (at group level): 1 to 7 days you have option to apply stickness at app or LB level cookies
   - Deregisteration delay
   - Slow start duration

7. True or original soruce will be inserted in X-Forwarded-Port and Proto headers (Ref PCAP in assest folder - "EC2-IngressTrafficFromALB")

8. Cross zone load-balancing is Always on (Can't be disabled - No charges for inter AZ data)

9. Supports multiple SSL certificates. Use SNI to make it work.


NETWORK LOAD BALANCER
---------------------
1. Create > Internal or Internet facing (required pulic IP) > IPv4 or dualstack > Subnet assingment > Listner and routing (tg)
2. Target group options are same as ALB
3. Traffic types L4 - TCP, UDP, TCP_UDP
4. NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
5. NLB are for extereme perfomance
6. Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instance
7. IMP: Cross zone load-balancing is disable by default (You pay inter AZ data if enabled)
8. Supports multiple SSL certificates. Use SNI to make it work.
