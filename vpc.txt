Notes:
------
1. When using public address space, all communication between instances and services hosted in AWS use 
AWS's private network. Packets that originate from the AWS network with a destination on the AWS network 
stay on the AWS global network, except traffic to or from AWS China Regions.
2. 200 Subnets per VPC AND 5 Elatic IP Address per AWS account per region
3. /28 and /16 in size CIDR and IPv6 has fized /56 CIDR
4. Can expand VPC by adding non-overlapping 4 IPv4 IP ranges
5. Cannot change primary interface IP for instance lifetime
6. EIPs cannot be used for instance in private or NAT configured Subnets
7. Security Group: works at instance level - stateful and only allow rule
8. NACL: at subnet level with both allow and deny and stateless
9. VPC flow logs => to monitor the network traffic
10. Traffic Mirroring for content inspection (support all EC2 Nitro instances)
11. Subnet doesn't span AZ
12. You can attach or detach ENI while intance is running
13. You can attach and detach secondary interfaces (eth1-ethn) on an EC2 instance, but you canâ€™t detach the eth0 interface.
14. Peering VPC must have non-overlapping IP ranges
15. Transitive peering is not supported
16. Security groups cannot be referenced across an Inter-Region VPC Peering connection.
